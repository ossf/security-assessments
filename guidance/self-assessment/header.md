# Header Content

**[< Previous: Getting Started](./getting-started-self-assessment.md)**

Let's kick things off by putting in some basic information about the project and the assessment itself.

## Header & Opening

Let's open up the document with some very basic details.

The document title should be your project’s name followed by “Self-Assessment”

Directly beneath the title, include plaintext information specifying who conducted this assessment and identifying the project maintainers. The provided template includes helper text with blanks you can fill in to streamline this step.

## Table of Contents

If you're using a word processor like Google Docs or Microsoft Word, take advantage of their automatic table of contents generation.

For Markdown-based documentation, you can create self-referencing links within the document—these will become functional once the relevant sections exist.

Expect to revisit and update the table of contents after adding content. If you introduce new subsections for complex topics, be sure to reflect those changes here. If your document significantly expands upon the template, AI tools may assist in generating or updating the table of contents efficiently.
