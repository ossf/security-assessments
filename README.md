# Open Source Project Security Assessments

In response to a rising demand for standardized security review of open source projects, the Open Source Project Security (OSPS) Assessments project provides a tiered model for assessing the security state of open source software.

## Approach

OSPS Assessments may come in one of two types: self-assessment or joint-assessment. This tiered approach is intended to reduce complexity through a "shift left" approach that encourages participation from project maintainers while also reducing overall cost and complexity.   

### Getting Started

Visit [the Getting Sarted guide](./guidance/getting-started.md) to determine your first steps, including which of the assessments is right for your situation. In most cases, it is recommended to start at the lowest level, self-assessments, and work up from there.

Continue reading below for a rapid overview of each assessment type.

### Level 1: Self-Assessment

A self-assessment allows a software project to evaluate its own security posture using a standardized process. This helps identify strengths, areas for improvement, and potential risks without external influence. The results can serve as a foundation for internal discussions, decision-making, and future external reviews.

### Level 2: Joint Assessment

A joint-assessment is a collaborative security review conducted with external security experts or a designated working group. This approach provides an opportunity for project teams to receive constructive feedback, validate security practices, and gain insights from experienced reviewers. The process often includes structured discussions, evidence-based evaluations, and actionable recommendations for strengthening security practices.
